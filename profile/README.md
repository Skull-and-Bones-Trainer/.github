Crafted for **Skull and Bones**, this trainer focuses on refinement rather than excess. It enhances what you already do well, polishing instinct into intention.

## 🌊 Overview — Control the Tide, Not the Storm

This trainer is modular, deliberate, and quiet by design. Every system can be enabled, tuned, or left sleeping beneath the waves. Whether you’re grinding trade routes, dueling rival captains, or navigating hostile waters heavy with fog and iron, the trainer adapts to your tempo.

It doesn’t shout orders. It adjusts the helm.

## 🎯 Combat Precision & Cannon Handling

**Combat modules include:**

* 🎯 **Cannon aim stabilization** with smooth interpolation
* 💥 **Trajectory guidance** for long-range volleys
* ⚖️ **Target lead assist** based on enemy speed
* ⏱ Adjustable humanized delay for natural behavior

Every slider exists for one reason: to keep combat believable and controlled.

> [!NOTE]
> All combat assistance is designed to feel organic, avoiding abrupt snaps or artificial motion.
